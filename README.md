 # Employee Workload Forecaster

A lightweight, low-cost workload forecasting tool designed to help small 
and medium-sized businesses visualize and optimize team effort across 
concurrent projects.

## Problem Statement
Small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) operate under tight financial and 
staffing constraints. Without visibility into who is working on what—and 
how much capacity is available—teams risk burnout, delivery delays, and 
inefficient resource allocation. Most existing tools are either too 
complex or too expensive for SMBs.

The Employee Workload Forecaster delivers decision-grade insights at 
near-zero cost, helping leaders make better tradeoffs and stay focused on 
strategic goals.

## Target Users
- Startup founders managing small, cross-functional teams  
- Project managers and program leads with limited resourcing  
- Operations or BizOps managers supporting executive planning  
- Chiefs of Staff needing visibility across multiple workstreams  

## Solution Overview
This Python-based app (Streamlit) ingests a list of tasks with owners, 
durations, estimated effort, and priorities. It outputs a dashboard-style 
visualization of per-person workload, capacity flags, and KPI 
alignment—all in under 2 minutes.

## Key Features
- CSV Upload or Manual Entry: Task, owner, dates, estimated hours, 
priority  
- Dashboard Visualization: Weekly workload heatmap by team member  
- KPI Tagging: Tasks mapped to business goals or OKRs  
- Overload Detection: Highlights individuals over their weekly capacity  
- Prioritization View: Elevates high-priority tasks that may be 
under-resourced  
- (Optional) GPT Suggestions: Rebalancing and timeline shift suggestions 
via OpenAI API  

## Success Metrics
| Metric                   | Target |
|-------------------------|--------|
| Time to Insight         | < 2 minutes |
| Task-to-KPI Coverage    | 100% |
| Priority Alignment      | >90% of critical tasks properly staffed |
| External Use Cases      | 3 or more real-world pilots or user tests |

## Security Considerations
- All inputs are validated and sanitized; only `.csv` files accepted  
- Uploaded data is stored in-session only; no persistent logging or 
sharing  
- OpenAI API keys are secured via environment variables (never hardcoded)  
- GPT suggestions use constrained prompts with max token limits and safe 
defaults  
- Recommended deployment is behind authenticated access (Streamlit Cloud 
or OAuth)

## Performance Considerations
- Input is capped at 500 tasks per upload to ensure responsiveness  
- Charts and calculations are memoized where appropriate  
- All API calls have error handling, timeouts, and fallback logic  
- No persistent storage = reduced attack surface and low memory overhead  
- Future plans include basic test coverage and logging for stability 
monitoring  

## Testing
- Unit tests planned for core logic functions (data parsing, allocation, 
overload detection)  
- Future: Test coverage report and integration into CI/CD pipeline

## Versioning and Licensing
- Current version: v0.1 (early-stage MVP)  
- License: MIT License

## Future Enhancements
- "What-if" scenario modeling (e.g., add/remove team member)  
- API integrations (Jira, Notion, ClickUp)  
- Slack or email alerts for overloads and missed priorities  
- Historical velocity tracking to improve forecast accuracy  

This project was built as a working proof-of-concept to demonstrate AI 
fluency, product sense, and business operations expertise. It reflects the 
practical application of AI/ML and Python to solve real-world challenges 
in resource-constrained environments.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repo  
2. Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
3. Run the app locally with `streamlit run app/app.py`  
4. Upload your CSV or enter tasks manually to see forecasts
